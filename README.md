Some data science projects that I developed.

In the credit_approval project, you need to extract the files from the zip before running it yourself locally. Be sure where you place the files so that the code does not return any error, or you can change the code ot read the files in the directory you placed them.

The stock_prediction project does not have files because we download them directly from Yahoo Finance thanks to the yfinance package.
